**Big Oh Notation** : 
Used for 
1. Worst case 
2. Upper-bound
**Omega Notation** : 
Used for
1. Best case
**Theta Notation** : 
Used for
1. Average case 
$1,2,3,4,----N$ sum up to 
	$n*(n+1)/2$
##### What is space complexity 
The amount of memory space the program will be taking. 
Big Oh Notation is used to represent it. 

Auxiliary space : Space taken to solve a problem. 
Input space : Space taken to store the input and outputs for a given problem.
