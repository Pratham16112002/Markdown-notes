It is like digital security of computers, servers and data. It's a set of practices and technologies that prevents technologically powered devices from being hacked, damaged or stolen by bad actors on the internet .
## CIA 
<span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>Confidentiality</span>
No Unauthorized access or restrict the access to authorized users only. 
This means that sensitive data should not be disclosed to any unauthorized persons or systems. 
Security measures like encryption 
	By encrypting the data, we make sure that none other than the authorized person can see the data without the key to unlock the encryption. 
Access Controls 
	By some access control mechanism we can restrict the access to the data to some specific employees only , rather than every employee of the organization. 
Authentication 
	By added some Biometrics, ( 2FA ) before accessing the data might increase its confidentiality of the data. 
Secure Transmission 
	By using some secure protocols like HTTPS instead of HTTP and SSL protocol. 
<span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>Integrity</span>
Means the make sure the accuracy and reliability of the data . 
No modification of data should be done by any unauthorized person or parties. 
Security measures like hashing and checksums 
	Generating a hash value of the data using some crypto-graphic functions and then comparing the hash values at every moment while the data is in transmission. 
Digital Signatures : 
	A electronic signature is added with the data while transmission and when receiver receive the data then he/she verify the digital signature and make sure that data is not modified. 
<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Availability</span>
Make sure that data should be available to the right person when he/she needs it.
System should be reliable and accessible anytime.
Redundancy 
	My having all the data duplicated in organization makes sure data is accessible anytime, if one server fails the the data can be transfered
