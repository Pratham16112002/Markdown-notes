It is like digital security of computers, servers and data. It's a set of practices and technologies that prevents technologically powered devices from being hacked, damaged or stolen by bad actors on the internet .

<span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>Confidentiality</span>
No Unauthorized access or restrict the access to authorized users only. 
This means that sensitive data should not be disclosed to any unauthorized persons or systems. 
**Security measures like encryption**
	By encrypting the data, we make sure that none other than the authorized person can see the data without the key to unlock the encryption. 
**Access Controls** 
	By some access control mechanism we can restrict the access to the data to some specific employees only , rather than every employee of the organization. 
**Authentication** 
	By added some Biometrics, ( 2FA ) before accessing the data might increase its confidentiality of the data. 
**Secure Transmission** 
	By using some secure protocols like HTTPS instead of HTTP and SSL protocol. 
<span style='color:red;font-weight:bold;'>Integrity</span>
Means the make sure the accuracy and reliability of the data . 
No modification of data should be done by any unauthorized person or parties. 
**Security measures like hashing and checksums** 
	Generating a hash value of the data using some crypto-graphic functions and then comparing the hash values at every moment while the data is in transmission. 
**Digital Signatures** : 
	A electronic signature is added with the data while transmission and when receiver receive the data then he/she verify the digital signature and make sure that data is not modified. 
<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Availability</span>
Make sure that data should be available to the right person when he/she needs it.
System should be reliable and accessible anytime.
**Redundancy** 
	My having all the data duplicated in organization makes sure data is accessible anytime, if one server fails the the duplicate data can be transferred immediately. 
**Regular Backups**
	To make sure that in case of any damage to data, data can be easily restored. 
**24x7 Power Availability**
**DOS protection**
	Implementing DOS strategies, like rate limiting and traffic limiting . 
> DDOS and DOS affect the availability of the data. 

## Threats and vulnerabilities
**Threat** : Any potential circumstance or event that can harm an information system by destroying it or disclosing it or stealing from it or changing it. 
**Vulnerabilities** : Weakness in the information system that can be exploited by attacker. 

## Phishing
It is a cyber crime in which attackers attempt to deceive the individual or organization to disclose their confidential information to them. 
Typically involves : 
1. Deception : The attackers sometimes impersonate as a trusted entity by sending fake email to the individual or organization . 
2. Bait : The attackers try to lure the victim by offering him/her very tempting offer or urgent emergency messages. 
3. Clicking malcious
