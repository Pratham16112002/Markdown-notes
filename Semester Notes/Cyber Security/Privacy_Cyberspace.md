3. **Password management** : Involves adhering to best practices & techniques while storing passwords securely.

### Concepts

* **Data Privacy** : This refers to the protection of sensitive & personal information shared online.
* **Anonymity** : It involves ability to participate in online activities without revealing one's true identity.
* **Encryption** : It's a technique that is used to encode the information so that only authorized parties can see and access it.
* **Data Minimization** : By collecting only necessary data and limiting collecting sensitive information we can prevent the extent of data loss.
* **Security Measures** : Robust security measures like strong passwords and multi-factor authentication & regular security patches.
* **Digital footprints** : The data stored on online websites with internet activities should be minimized like purchase history, card details, address and phone numbers should be minimized.

### Privacy Principles and Policies in Cyberspace

* **Data Minimization** : _Principle_ Collect and retain only a minimal amount of personal information necessary for a specific purpose. _Policy_ organizations should limit the collection and storage of personal data of their customers, collecting only necessary data.

* **Data security** : _Principle_ Implement robust security measures to prevent sensitive data from being lost breached or even leaked. _Policy_ Encryption, access controls and regular security updates should be done to ensure data security.
* **Accountability**: _Principle_ The Organization should violate if any privacy policy principle is violated. _Policy_ Establish internal measuring techniques to monitor any privacy violation within the organization.
* **Transparency** : _Principle_ Be transparent about the practices and policies. _Policies_ Privacy policies should be easily accessible to anyone and written in clear and direct language.

### Privacy in email security 

* **Encryption** : Ensure that content is unreadable to any third party without the decryption key. End to end encryption secure the message send from sender to recipent. 
* **Use of secure protocols** : Employing secure communication protocols like ( TLS ), to ensure email are sent securely. 
* **Strong authentication** : Implementing robust authentication methods like SPF, DKIM, etc. 
* **User training & awareness** : Educating users about email scams that are bound to happen like suspicious links attachments or phishing attempts by attackers.
* **Secure email services & tools** : Use reputable email services and applications that provide features like encryption, spam filters and malware scanning. 
* **Regular software updates & patches** : Ensuring that the email servers are regularly updated.
