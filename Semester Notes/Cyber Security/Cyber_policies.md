# Cyber Policies


## Mitigate cyber risk

1. **Risk Management** : Establishing policies for regular risk assesment to identify and prioritize potential cyber security threats and vulnerabilities. 
2. **Establish network access controls** : Organizations can implement security systems like zero trust, where all the users are continuously monitored before accessing any application or resource. This will prevent any malicious attack from happening from outside as well as inside the network. 
3. **Implementing firewall and threat detection system** : Firewall and other threat detection systems will monitor your system & network and look for any potential attacks that can happen. 
4. **Installing latest security patches** : Installing regular security updates helps to mitigate cyber risk, the faster the security loopholes are removed more harder it will be for attackers to exploit those loopholes. 
5. **Conducting reg
ular employee training** : Spreading awareness about how to identify and handle a cyber attack, Letting employees know about common attacks possible in this cyber world. 
6. **Minimizing attack surface** : All the potentially vulnerable spots or areas in a network or system should be monitored carefully or removed if possible.


## Reduce supply chain risk

1. **Vender risk management** : Establishing a policies and strategies that secure the entire network as well as the third party vendors and partners to maintian the security standards. 
2. Testing the security measures of vendors including their data protection practices , cyber policies and incident response capabilities. 
3. **Continous monitoring and auditing** : Developing policies for continuous monitoring and regular audits of vendor activities. 
4. **Data encryption** : Implementing data encryption to sensitive information when being shared over the supply chains to protect it from unauthorized access.
5. **Security Training and awareness to all third party vendors**.
6. **Regular security patches should be installed on all vendors**. 


### Cyber security framework

Set of guidelines, standards, and best practices to better manage cyber security risks. <br>

#### NIST

* Is is a type of cyber security framework. 
* Divided into three main components. 
  *  Core
  *  Tires 
  *  Profiles
* Functions included in framework.
  * **Identify** It provides the basis for an organization to identify its system, people, assets, data and all the things that manage cyber security risks. 
  * **Protect** It ensures the development and implementation of cybersecurity safeguards to protect people as well as organizations.
  * **Detect** Development and implementation of appropriate activities to identify occurance of cybersecurity attacks. 
  * **Respond** This refers to the development and implementation of appropriate activities for responding detected cybersecurity threats and attacks. 
  * **Recover** This refers to the development and implementation of appropriate activities to restore the services that were damaged in a cyber security attack. 
* **Profile** : refers to the state of being, They help the organization to understand current cyber security postures and plan future security targets. 
    * **Target Profile** : It can be described as the future or upcoming cyber security state of an organization.  
    * **Current Profile** : It is described as the current cyber security posture of an organization. 
    * **Gap analysis** : It is the comparison between target profile and the current profile.
* **Tires** Referred to as maturity levels of an organization, They define where the organization is with respect to the cybersecurity guidelines and recommendations.<br>

> Tier 1 (Partial) $<$ Tier 2 ( Risk Informed ) $<$ Tier 3 ( Repetable ) $<$ Tier 4 ( Adaptive ).

_Partial_ It means that the organization is not well prepared at all. <br>
_Risk-Informed_ It means that an organization may have defined procedures to deal with incidents but no proper implementation. <br>
_Repeatable_ It means that an organization may have implemented procedures to deal with incidents but lacks to respond to real-time events.<br>
_Adaptive_ Organization can respond to real-time incidents.
