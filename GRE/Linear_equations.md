# Linear equations

- Involves more than one variables.
- Each term is constant or a coefficient multiplied by a variable.
- No variables raised to the power greater than 1.--
- No variables multiplied together.

When the line is drawn on the graph, the line will always be straight.

**In terms of solutions** :
A linear equation has :

- No solution.
- One solution.
- Infinitely many solutions.

## Quadratic equations

Equation with :

- Maximum degree of 2.
- The coefficient of the highest degree ( which is 2) is not 0.

## Roots of a quadratic equation

Quadratic equation can have only :

1. zero roots.
2. one root.
3. two real roots.

## Quadratic formula

$$ \dfrac{ -b+- \sqrt{ { b }^{ 2 } -4ac \phantom{\tiny{!}}} }{ 2a } $$

Memorize this formula to get a good score in the exam.

## Linear inequalities

Symbols we use :

- $<$ : less than
- $>$ : greater than
- $\leq$ : less than or equal to
- $\geq$ : greater than or equal to

**Rules** :

- Adding and subtracting the same number from both sides of the inequality does not change the inequality.
- Multiplying or dividing both sides of inequality by a positive number does not change the inequality but with the negative number the inequality sign changes.
- When the signs of two inequalities are equal then you are allowed to add those inequalities.
- You cannot subtract inequalities from each other even if the signs are different.
- When the sings are facing different directions , you can subtract the though. but the signs of the first one inequality on the final inequality-

## Functions

Different inputs can result in the same output.

> When checking the domain of a variable in a function always check in the original formula rather than the simplified equation.

> Trivial means very obvious , something of very little importance.
