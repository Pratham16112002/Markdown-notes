# Real numbers

Can be divided into two main categories:

1. Rational numbers.
2. Irrational numbers.

**Rational Numbers** :  
numbers that can be written as a fraction.

$3/4$ or $0.75$ is a rational number.

**Irrational Numbers** :  
numbers that cannot be written as fraction.

$\sqrt{2}$ or $\pi$ are irrational numbers.

> A real number has a point on the number line.

## Absolute value

It means how far a number is from zero.

$$ \left| X \right| = 2$$

👆 this means what values of x are 2 units away from zero.

**Solving absolute value equations** :

- Remove the bars.
- write the two equations.
- solve both of them.

## Check for real number solutions

$$ { b }^{ 2 } -4ac$$

Its called discriminant.

☝️ value:

1. +ve : 2 distinct real roots.
2. 0 : 1 real root.
3. -ve : no real roots.
