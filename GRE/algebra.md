# Algebra

**Variable** : A letter that represents a quantity thats value is unknown.

> Variables are always written in italics.

Constants : where the power of variable is 0.

Coefficient : The number is front of the variable.

**Polynominal** : An expression which represents a sum of finite number of terms in which each term is a constant term or product of cofficient and one or more variables raised to a positive integral power.

Degree of a polynomial : The highest power of the coefficient in the polynomial.

## Identities

$$ { \left( A+B \right) }^{ 2 } = { A }^{ 2 } + { B }^{ 2 } +2AB $$.

$$ { \left( A-B \right) }^{ 2 } = { A }^{ 2 } + { B }^{ 2 } -2AB $$

$$ { A }^{ 2 } - { B }^{ 2 } = \left( A+B \right) \left( A-B \right) $$

$$ { \left( a+b \right) }^{ 3 } = { a }^{ 3 } + { b }^{ 3 } +3 { a }^{ 2 } b+3a { b }^{ 2 } $$

$$ { \left( a-b \right) }^{ 3 } = { a }^{ 3 } - { b }^{ 3 } -3 { a }^{ 2 } b+3a { b }^{ 2 } $$

> In ETS $0^1$ is undefined (note ) .

## Important formula

Work = Rate $*$ Time

When two things are working together we add their respective rates to get the total rate.  
When two things are working against each other we subtract their respective rates to get the total rate.

## Mixture Problems

Q : Given two types of exams having two different weightages, mid term exam 30% and final exam is 70%. A student scored 75% in his final exam and 40% in his mid term exam find his total percentage ?

Formula would be : $0.3 * 40/100 + 0.7 * 75/100 = 61.5%$.

These problems are also called weighted average problems.

## Interest Problems

$$ A = P { \left( 1+ \dfrac{ r }{ n } \right) }^{ nt } $$

SI : Simple Interest does not changes with time it remains constant.

The relationship between time and amount is linear.

_Modified and simple formula_ :

$$ A = P+rate \cdot n \cdot P$$

**Compound Interest** : Interest on interest.

Compound Interest is always greater than the simple interest.  
Compound interest is an exponential relationship.
